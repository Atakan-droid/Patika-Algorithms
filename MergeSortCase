# Merge Sort Case

## Question:

Here is an Array: [16,21,11,8,12,22] 
* Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.
* Write the Big-O notation.

#
### Solution :

In Merge Sort ,we divide the array until single index remain.

1-  [16,21,11] [8,12,22] \
2-  [16,21] [11]  [8,12] [22] \
3-  [16] [21] [11] [8] [12] [22] \
4-  [16,21] [11] [8,12] [22] \
5-  [11,16,21] [8,12,22] \
6-  [8,11,12,16,21,22] 

The Time Complexity is O(nlogn)
