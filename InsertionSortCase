# Insertion Sort Case

## Question:

Here is an Array: [22,27,16,2,18,6]
* Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.
Write the Big-O notation.
* Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.
* What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write.
#
### Solution :

1-> 2 and 22 swipe => [2,27,16,22,18,6] \
2-> 6 and 27 swipe => [2,6,16,22,18,27] \
3-> 18 and 22 swipe => [2,6,16,18,22,27]

Every time we need to check the whole array -1 so our time comploexity O(N2)

Insertion Sort Algorithms all cases are O(N2).

After we sort the array ,18 is in the middle ,so that will be Average Case.
