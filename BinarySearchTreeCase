# Binary Search Tree Case

## Question:

Here is an Array: [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] 
* Write down the search tree stages

#
### Solution :

So I choose '0' as the root for the worst case

It will be like this:

                    0
                        7
                    5       8
                3      6        9
            1   

if we looking for 1 than it will cost us almost O(n)
